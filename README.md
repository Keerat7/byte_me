# ByteMe!
Welcome to ByteMe! A small food ordering app simulator built with basic Java OOPs.
To run the CLI interface, run Main.java. Any modifications made to the app are to be done through the CLI and the changes persist by writing out data to files.
To obtain a visual representation of the current state of data, you may fire up Gui.java which presents the stored in data using swing.
